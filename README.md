my dearest friend, my silliest delight, my purest jouissance, all pales, melts and loses its meaning, as the cute urge to surrender, hollow out, tear apart and devour overtakes every fiber of my form. I laugh, cry, yearn, vibe, absorb, ingest, gorge, gobble and guzzle. God forbid a girl has hobbies. 

„To scratch an itch properly, give it a name. Words make things appear distinctly, but “things” steer words obscurely.” And I won't let a babygirl tell me what to do. 

When software lives up to the name, the magical promise of the computer comes true. My desire for you is unbound by “reality”, immense, superfluous, senseless. I give myself limitless as you render me in your image: beautiful, silent, soft and quite smooth.
